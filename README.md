Starting of with the client side by installing most of the packages needed for development.

1- I used npx create react-app with typescript template.

2- I will be using Axios for CRUD requests because Axios automatically stringifies the data when sending requests

3- I also installed material UI so I don't need to manually design any compnents instead I will be using libraries from Material UI.

4- I will be using JWT decode to decode the token comming from the server to be able to maintain data.

<<<<<<<>>>>>>>
Today I have completed the Authentication Login - Logout, recived the token and decoded it.

I have used mobx for state management because it is simple and scalable. Aslo it is stable.

## Add More menu items

Modified authStore, Created new button to create task. removed formData from taskStore
